Header
0x0		0x4		Magic "XQ32"

0x8		0x4		n<<2 = headersize
0xc		0x2		n<<2 = table 1 offset

0x10	0x2		n<<2 = table 2 offset

0x16	0x2		n<<2 = table 3 offset

Table 1 (Level5 compressed)
Collection of 0xc long entries
0x0		0x2		n*8 into table 2
0x2		0x2		commandCount in table 2
0x4		0x2		only 0x3e9?
0x6		0x2		?
0x8		0x4		only zer0?

Table 2 (Level5 compressed)
Collection of commands?
0x0		0x4		command code
0x4		0x4		value for this code

Command codes known
LSB seems to be not part of the code itself, but seems to indicate something.
After shifting code 1 bit to right following codes appear:
0x0 - integer?
0x1 - hash?
0x2 - ?
0xe - string -> command value is offset into table 3 then, to gather the string

Table 3 (Level5 compressed)
Strings to be called by command codes from Table 2
