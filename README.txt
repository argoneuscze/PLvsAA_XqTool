this is an incomplete project but it kind of works

it's basically a C# GUI tool to read and edit .xq files

in the "emotes" folder there's also emotes extracted from the .xq files and a script to turn those emotes into something you can put in .xs and play the stuff

please don't ask me for help I don't even remember what half of this stuff is
